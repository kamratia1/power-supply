#Power Supply

This project is a custom hardware development for a variable power supply based on EEVBlog uSupply ([https://www.eevblog.com/projects/usupply/])

The microcontroller used is the STM32F030C6T6. This repository contains the source code for the power supply written using the IAR Embedded Workbench IDE. 

##Power Supply Features: 
* 0 - 15V Output Voltage
* 0 - 1A Output Current
* Output Isolating Relay
* 128 x 160 Colour LCD display (SPI Interface - Display used is the Arduino TFT Screen ([https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/TFT])
* Output On/Off Switch 
* 1 x Rotary Encoder with push button

## Hardware
The hardware is custom built using EAGLE. The schematic is available in this repository and full eagle files shall be made available in the future.
